Spring Boot:
--------------
        Spring boot is an Frame Work for Java that is build on top of Spring that simplifies Application Development
        It Supports
                ->web Application
                ->Rest Api's
                ->microservices
                ->security
                ->and for cloud Deployment


why Sprint boot?
            ->Fast Development
            ->Auto-configuration
            ->microservices friendly
            ->Seamless Integration

Features of SprintBoot:
-----------------------
                ->Auto-Configuration: Automatically configures components (like Hibernate, JPA) based on dependencies. 
                ->Easy Maintenance and Creation of REST Endpoints: With annotations like @RestController, @GetMapping and @PostMapping, creating REST endpoints is straightforward.


Annotations Explanation:

1.Core Basic Annotation:

@SpringBootApplication:
----------------------
                  ->Main Entry Point of Spring Boot
                  ->example:
                  @SpringBootApplication
                              public class DemoApplication {
                                          public static void main(String[] args) {
                                          SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
                                                 }
                                          }

@Component
----------
                  -It tells spring This is a class manage it for manage
                  @Component
                  public class EmailService {}

                        
@Autowired
----------

      ->  @autowired:@Autowired is used to automatically connect (inject) one class into another in Spring Boot.
      ->  we usually connect Repository / service to the controller

            example:
              @Autowired
             private bookrepo bookRepo;

@Bean:
-----
      ->it is used to create Object Manually and gives it to Spring
      @Bean
            public ModelMapper modelMapper()
            {
                  return new ModelMapper();
            }
        

2.Steriotype Annotation:

@controller
------------
            ->handels web pages 
                @Controller
                public class PageController {
                }

@service
---------
            ->it Holds Business logics
