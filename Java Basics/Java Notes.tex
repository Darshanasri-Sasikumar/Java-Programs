Java Features
1.Java is platform Independent Programming Languvange
2.Simple and Secured in Nature 
3.It is an Object Oriented Programming Languvange
4.Java Supports Muliti-Threading
5.Robust in Nature((strong typing, exception handling, automatic memory))

why Java is Platform Independent Languvange
1.Java Supports WORA(Write Once and Run AnyWhere)
2.Any Program that is Return in Java can be executed in any Platform
3.Java is Independent Languvange but Jvm is dependent One
4.Here Executable file is .class which contains byte code

Compiler 
1.Compiler work is to check Java code and then Conver it into byte Code
2.It is used to List Syntax Mistakes
3.The compiler (javac) converts it into a .class file that contains bytecode.(bytecode is nothing but a special intermediate code)
4.It checks the entire program before running it.
5.It can make a program Compile Time Sucess (CTS) and Compile time Error (CTE)

Interpreter
1.JVM is Interpreter
2.It Converts Bite Code into Binary Code

JDK(Java Development Kit)
1.It contains two Important Documents
2.It contains TWO Important Components ie.. Development Tools and JRE(Java Run Time Environment)
3.JVM is Present inside JRE
4.JVM Job is to Convert Byte Code into binary

Commands
Compilation command-->javac FileName.java
Execution command-->java ClassName

Java Memory Areas (Very basic introduction)

Stack
Heap
Method Area
Class Area

Java Architecture Flow
Java Source Code → .java file
Compiler (javac) → converts to .class (bytecode)
JVM → Converts Bytecode to Machine Code (Binary)
OS → Executes Machine Code


Tokens:
In Java, tokens are the smallest meaningful units of a program.
There are 5 types of Tokens:
          1.Keywords
          2.identifier
          3.Operators
          4.literals
          5.special symbols


Keywords
1.keywords are reserved words
2.It is Predefined Words and also called as reserved Word
3.We have 49+ keywords
4.some of them are public,static,int,double,void,final,abstract etc.....

identifier
1.In java we are having components such as class,variable,methods ,interface called as identifiers
2.it is used for identifyin class,method,variable or interface
Rules of Identifeirs:
    1.Can't Start with Numbers But we can Have Numbers inbetween or Last
    2.Except $ and _ can't use other Special Characters
    3.Wide spaces or not allowd
    4.Keywords can't be named for Identifeirs

Operators
1.it is Pre-defined symbols to perform Operations
2.List of Operators
  1.Arithmatic Operators
  2.TypeCast Operators
  3.Relational Operator
  4.Logical Operators
  5.Conditional Operators
  6.Increament and Decreament Operator
  7.Compound Assignment Operator

literals
1.Literals are nothing but Fixed values that can be written in java programming Languvange
2.The literal is the actual value stored inside the variable

Data Types (Primitive & Non-Primitive)
1.Primitive Data Types
2.byte
3.short
4.int
5.long
6.float
7.double
8.char
9.boolean

Non-Primitive Types
String
Array
Class
Interface
Enum

Type Casting
1.Process of Converting one datatype into Another datatype is TypeCastine
We have two types of type casting
Primitive Type casting and Non -Primitive Type casting

Primitive Casting:
   Converting one primitive data type into another primitive data type is know as Primitive data type is know as Primitive type casting
   We have 2 types of Primitive type casting:
         1.Widening
         2.Narrowing
    


    Widening:
           The Process of converting Lower range of primitive datat type into higher range of primitive data type is called widening
           it is an Implicit process
           We can achive widening by typecaste operator or non type caste operator

           Example:
           public class widening {
                  public static void main(String[] args) {
                   // example for widening
                    int num = 10;
                    long number = num;
                    float no = number;
                    System.out.println(no);
                 }
        }

    Q1.Can we achive widening Explicitly?
    ->yes

    Narrowing:
            The Process of converting higher Range of Primitive types into Lower Range of Prmitive types is known as Narrowing
            In Narrowing we can face Data Loss
            so we can expect Compile time error
            We can Achive Narrowing only by type caste operator

            Example:
             public class widening {
                  public static void main(String[] args) {
                   // example for widening

                      double a =10.00;
                      int b = (int)a;

                     System.out.println(b);
                   
                 }
               }

Non-Primitve Type casting:
      1.upcasting 
      2.Down Casting

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Control Flow statements:
    Controlling the flow of execution is know as Control flow Stmts

we have 2 type of Control flow statements:
        1.Decision making statements->if,else,else if,else if ladder and switch(Examples in Number Programming)
        2.Looping statements->while,do while,for loop advance foreach loop

switch->we cannot pass long ,float ,boolean,double type of data type we can face data loss


Break:
   1.it is a keyword
   2.used to exist from loop
   3.it stops from further iterations

Continue:
   1.it is keyword
   2.It is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration.

Return:
  1.End a method and send a value back
  2.it is a keyword


  Method:

   It is A block of instruction it is used to Perform a task
   A method is a block of code which runs when it is been called
   Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.
   A method can also be called multiple times:
      ->Code Reusability
      ->Readability
      ->better Programming structure
      ->Reduces code length
      ->Easy debugging
   Syntax:
   Access Modifier,Modifier,return type,Method Name,([Data type one and Data type 2])

  We have 2 types of Method:
      1.Parameterized Method
      2.Non-Parameterized Method
  


  Access Modifier:
         This decideds the visibility of the mothod
                    1.public ->all
                    2.private ->within the same class
                    3.default ->within package
                    4.protected->same package but sub class of other package
  
  Modifier:
         These are components which decideds the characterstics of method
         1.static ->belongs to class no Object required
         2.final ->Cannot be ovveriden
         3.Abstract -> No body must be Override
         4.Synchronized->Thread safe
   
   Return Type:
         Specifies what kind of data can be written
         1.void->no return required
         2.Primitive Data type->int ,byte,float,long,double
         3.Non - primitive data type ->string,class,Arrays
   
   return Keyword
      Used to return data to the caller.
      Transfers the control back to the calling method.
      It is Also called as control tranfer Statement
      If written before last line → other lines become unreachable.
   

Can I use return keyword inside constructor?
   yes but it Does Not return Any value



Parameterized Method
----------------------
             Information that can be passed inside a method is called Parameterized Method
             we can pass n parameter by seperating them with comma
             ex:
                public static method(String name){
                  System.out.println("Enter the name" + name);

                }


                public static void main(String[]args){
                  method();
                  
                }



   Types of Methods:
   1.No argument method:
     ex:
        public class method (){}
   
   2.Parameterized method: 
     ex:
        public class void method(int a , int b){}

   3.Static method:
      ex:
        static void show(){}

   4.Abstract method:
      ex:
        void method(){  }
   
   5.final method:
      ex:
       final void method(){}

Final:
final variable → value cannot change
final method → cannot override
final class → cannot be inherited



Explain Method call process:
     When ever method is Called Execution of the Prog Pause
     Control Tranfered to the Called method 
     Execution of Called Method Begins and Execute Completely
     Once Execution completed control is given back to the Caller


what is method overloading?
A class having same name but differnt formal argument is know as method overloading

    ex:
       public static add(int a, int b){
         Syste.out.println(a+b);
       }

       public static add(int a, int b , int c){
         System.out.prinln(a+b);
       }
       


Recursion:
    It is the process of calling itself know as Recursion
    there is a possibility for Run tim error i.e stack overflow Error
    By Providing finite call we can avoid this


    Constructor (Basics)

You only wrote one line. Add proper basics.

Constructor:
   Same name as class
   No return type
   Automatically called when object is created
   Used to initialize values
Types:
   Default constructor
   Parameterized constructor
   Copy constructor (Java doesn’t provide but can be created manually)

this Keyword:
Refers to current object
Used when variable name and parameter name are same
Used to call constructor

Super Keyword 
Refers to parent class object
Used to call parent constructor
Used to call parent method

Mathematical Task:
 1.Math.min(x,y)
 2.Math.max(x,y)
 3.Math.sqrt(x)
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arrays:
------
    1.  Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable with same data type 
        why should we need to use arrays?
          -To store multiple values in a single row
          -faster to acces using index
          -easy to loop using for or foreach loop
          -saves memory compare to variables
   ex:int [] arr ={1,2,3,4}


   2.We can declare arrays in 2 ways:
         A.int [] arr =[1,2,3,4]
         B.int arr[]={1,2,3}

   3.Creating and Allocating Memory for an Array
        int arr = new int[5];
   
   4.initializing Arrays:
       arr[0]=1;
       arr[1]=2;
       arr[2]=3;

    => other way of initializing
       int [] arr ={1,2,3,4,5}

    => Accessing Array Element:
       System.out.println(arr[1]);//this will give you first Element
      
    => To get Array length
       System.out.prinln(arr.length);
