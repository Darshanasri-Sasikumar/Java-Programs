Middleware:
            ->Middleware is a component that runs between the request and the response
            ->It is present inside a pipeline Acts As an GateKeeper between Request and responses
            ->pipeline means sequence of middle ware
            ->Used in Authentication and Authorization
            Request  →  Middleware 1 → Middleware 2 → Controller
            Response ←  Middleware 1 ← Middleware 2 ← Controller
            ->Authentication & Authorization
            ->Logging
            ->Exception handling
            ->Request/Response modification
            ->Routing

            Built-in Middleware Examples

UseAuthentication()

UseAuthorization()

UseRouting()

UseExceptionHandler()

UseCors()

UseStaticFiles()


Authentication->checks who you are
Authorization->what are the access you are
Dependency Injection - Dependency Injection is a design pattern where objects are given the things they need, instead of creating them by themselves.



MVC Pattern
-------

MVC stands for Model – View – Controller.
It is a design pattern used to separate application logic, UI, and data.

Model

        Holds database information
        Contains table structure
        Column names
        Data types
        Model is a class
        Supports features like Soft Deletes if required
        Communicates with the database
        It is also used to write the relationship like hasOne and hasMany(how to define na Navigation property->it has virtual keyword)
        Validation can be given as Annotation

Validation:
            given as Annotation
            or Fluent Api DB Context

Eager Loading:
            ->Loading all the related Datas along with main data in a single query or command using "include()"and .ThenInclude()

Lazy Loading:
            ->Loading Related Data only when it is called is lazy Loading

Expecilcit Loading:
            ->it is similar to LazyLoading but we should initiate related Data manually

📌 Example: Entity classes, data validation, database mapping

View

            Represents the User Interface (UI)
            Displays data to the user
            Uses technologies like:
            HTML
            CSS
            JavaScript
            jQuery
            Vue.js

Does not contain business logic

📌 Example: Pages, forms, tables, UI screens

Controller

                Acts as a bridge between Model and View
                Handles HTTP requests and responses
                Receives user input
                Calls Model to process data
                Sends data to View for display

📌 Example: Handles GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests

MVC Flow

            User sends a request
            Controller receives the request
            Controller interacts with Model
            Model returns data
            Controller passes data to View
            View displays the result to the user
