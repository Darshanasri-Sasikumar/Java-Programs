1.view
    A VIEW is a virtual table based on the result of a SQL query.
It does not store data physically, but retrieves data from underlying tables when accessed.
    ->It is a virtual table
    ->it does not take actual memory space
    ->reduces complexity of sql queries
2.index
        ->Index is an data base Object
        ->It improves speed of the retrival data from the table
        ->used for large data
        ->brings an exact matching records
        ->Quick to locate row without exact match to the table


CLUSTER:
        ->sorts and stores actuall table data
        ->only one cluster index is used in a table
        ->usually created on primary key 

Non-cluster:
        ->stores index seperately
        ->can have multiple non-cluster index
        ->can contain index 

3.cluster vs non-cluster
| Feature          | Clustered Index                                                 | Non-Clustered Index                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Storage          | **Reorders the actual table rows**                              | Separate structure from the table            |
| Number per table | Only **1 per table** (because rows can be ordered only one way) | Multiple indexes allowed                     |
| Speed            | Faster for **range queries**                                    | Slightly slower than clustered               |
| Use              | Primary key is usually clustered                                | Used on columns that are frequently searched |
| Example          | Table sorted by `emp_id`                                        | Index on `emp_name` to search quickly        |


4.rollbac,savepoint,commit
Commit - Used to permanently save the changes made in a transaction.
Commit;
Rollback - Used to undo the changes in the transaction
Rollback;
SavePoint - Used to set a check point inside a transaction

        INSERT INTO employee VALUES (1,'Ram');
        SAVEPOINT s1;
        UPDATE employee SET name='Ravi' WHERE id=1;
        ROLLBACK TO s1;   -- update undone
        COMMIT;           -- insert saved


5. These are windows function
  ROW_NUMBER()->it is used to assing unique values to the particular row
  RANK()-Same rank for same values
  DENSE_RANK()-Same rank for same values
  ROW_NUMBER gives unique numbers, RANK skips numbers on ties, and DENSE_RANK does not skip numbers.

6.Trigger:
        ->trigger is a database object that automatically executes an even accours
        such as insertion,updation and deletion

7.Transaction :
            Transaction are set of sql operation to perform particular task
            it can allows multiple database operation in single understanding
            ACID
            A-Atomocity->when ever one operation fails enter thing gets Rollback
            C-Consistance-Consistency ensures database rules are not broken.
            I-Isolation-Isolation ensures concurrent transactions do not affect each other.
            D-Durability-commit are store permanently

8.Temporary table:
            Temporary table is used to the data and gets drop after use

9.Normalization:
            Normalization is the process of organising data into the database and reduce data redendecy(duplicate) and anomaly
            To remove duplicate data
            To save storage
            To maintain data consistency
            To avoid insert, update, delete anomalies

->First Normal Form (1NF)
    ✔ No repeating groups
    ✔ Atomic (single) values only

->secound Nomral Form(2NF)
     ✔ Table must be in 1NF
     ✔ No partial dependency

->Third Normal Form (3NF)
✔ Table must be in 2NF
✔ No transitive dependency

🔁 Easy Memory Trick

        1NF → Atomic values
        2NF → No partial dependency
        3NF → No transitive dependency

Composite key:
                composite combination of combining 2 or more columns
                ->it ensures row unique

Arraysto copy()->is used to copy the array into exisitng record,copy the part of existing array
Array.Clone()->creates a new array copy to an element,Makes a new array

ref and out keyword

Multithreading with .NET
        ->Multi Threading is the process of containting multiple threads in c#


Hash Table:
        The Hashtable class represents a collection of key/value pairs that are organized based on the key
        this comes under System.collection 
        this provides various operation to be performed inside the hashtable

47. Write a Features of Generics in C#?
Generics is a technique that improves your programs in many ways such as:

It helps you in code reuse, performance, and type safety.
You can create your own generic classes, methods, interfaces, and delegates.
You can create generic collection classes. The .NET Framework class library contains many new generic collection classes in System.Collections.Generic namespace.
You can get information on the types used in generic data types at run-time.
