1.view
    A VIEW is a virtual table based on the result of a SQL query.
It does not store data physically, but retrieves data from underlying tables when accessed.
    ->It is a virtual table
    ->it does not take actual memory space
    ->reduces complexity of sql queries
2.index
        ->Index is an data base Object
        ->It improves speed of the retrival data from the table
        ->used for large data
        ->brings an exact matching records
        ->Quick to locate row without exact match to the table

3.cluster vs non-cluster
| Feature          | Clustered Index                                                 | Non-Clustered Index                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Storage          | **Reorders the actual table rows**                              | Separate structure from the table            |
| Number per table | Only **1 per table** (because rows can be ordered only one way) | Multiple indexes allowed                     |
| Speed            | Faster for **range queries**                                    | Slightly slower than clustered               |
| Use              | Primary key is usually clustered                                | Used on columns that are frequently searched |
| Example          | Table sorted by `emp_id`                                        | Index on `emp_name` to search quickly        |


4.rollbac,savepoint,commit
Commit - Used to permanently save the changes made in a transaction.
Commit;
Rollback - Used to undo the changes in the transaction
Rollback;
SavePoint - Used to set a check point inside a transaction

        INSERT INTO employee VALUES (1,'Ram');
        SAVEPOINT s1;
        UPDATE employee SET name='Ravi' WHERE id=1;
        ROLLBACK TO s1;   -- update undone
        COMMIT;           -- insert saved


5. These are windows function
  ROW_NUMBER()->it is used to assing unique values to the particular row
  RANK()-Same rank for same values
  DENSE_RANK()-Same rank for same values
  ROW_NUMBER gives unique numbers, RANK skips numbers on ties, and DENSE_RANK does not skip numbers.

6.Trigger:
        ->trigger is a database object that automatically executes an even accours
        such as insertion,updation and deletion

7.Transaction :
            Transaction are set of sql operation to perform particular task
            it can allows multiple database operation in single understanding
            ACID
            A-Atomocity->when ever one operation fails enter thing gets Rollback
            C-Consistance-Consistency ensures database rules are not broken.
            I-Isolation-Isolation ensures concurrent transactions do not affect each other.
            D-Durability-commit are store permanently

8.Temporary table:
            Temporary table is used to the data and gets drop after use

9.Normalization:
            Normalization is the process of organising data into the database and reduce data redendecy(duplicate) and anomaly
            To remove duplicate data
            To save storage
            To maintain data consistency
            To avoid insert, update, delete anomalies

->First Normal Form (1NF)
    ✔ No repeating groups
    ✔ Atomic (single) values only

->secound Nomral Form(2NF)
     ✔ Table must be in 1NF
     ✔ No partial dependency

->Third Normal Form (3NF)
✔ Table must be in 2NF
✔ No transitive dependency

🔁 Easy Memory Trick

        1NF → Atomic values
        2NF → No partial dependency
        3NF → No transitive dependency
