Java Features
1.Java is platform Independent Programming Languvange
2.Simple and Secured in Nature 
3.It is an Object Oriented Programming Languvange
4.Java Supports Muliti-Threading
5.Robust in Nature((strong typing, exception handling, automatic memory))

why Java is Platform Independent Languvange
1.Java Supports WORA(Write Once and Run AnyWhere)
2.Any Program that is Return in Java can be executed in any Platform
3.Java is Independent Languvange but Jvm is dependent One
4.Here Executable file is .class which contains byte code

Compiler 
1.Compiler work is to check Java code and then Conver it into byte Code
2.It is used to List Syntax Mistakes
3.The compiler (javac) converts it into a .class file that contains bytecode.(bytecode is nothing but a special intermediate code)
4.It checks the entire program before running it.
5.It can make a program Compile Time Sucess (CTS) and Compile time Error (CTE)

Interpreter
1.JVM is Interpreter
2.It Converts Bite Code into Binary Code

JDK(Java Development Kit)
1.It contains two Important Documents
2.It contains TWO Important Components ie.. Development Tools and JRE(Java Run Time Environment)
3.JVM is Present inside JRE
4.JVM Job is to Convert Byte Code into binary

Commands
Compilation command-->javac FileName.java
Execution command-->java ClassName

Tokens:
In Java, tokens are the smallest meaningful units of a program.
There are 5 types of Tokens:
          1.Keywords
          2.identifier
          3.Operators
          4.literals
          5.special symbols


Keywords
1.keywords are reserved words
2.It is Predefined Words and also called as reserved Word
3.We have 49+ keywords
4.some of them are public,static,int,double,void,final,abstract etc.....

identifier
1.In java we are having components such as class,variable,methods ,interface called as identifiers
2.it is used for identifyin class,method,variable or interface
Rules of Identifeirs:
    1.Can't Start with Numbers But we can Have Numbers inbetween or Last
    2.Except $ and _ can't use other Special Characters
    3.Wide spaces or not allowd
    4.Keywords can't be named for Identifeirs

Operators
1.it is Pre-defined symbols to perform Operations
2.List of Operators
  1.Arithmatic Operators
  2.TypeCast Operators
  3.Relational Operator
  4.Logical Operators
  5.Conditional Operators
  6.Increament and Decreament Operator
  7.Compound Assignment Operator

literals
1.Literals are nothing but Fixed values that can be written in java programming Languvange
2.The literal is the actual value stored inside the variable
